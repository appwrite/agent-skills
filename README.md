**This SDK is compatible with Appwrite server version 1.8.x. For older versions, please check [previous releases](https://github.com/appwrite/agent-skills.git/releases).**

Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstracts and simplifies complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way. Use the AgentSkills SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools.

## Getting Started

Agent Skills to help developers using AI coding agents with Appwrite. Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents like Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others can discover and use to work more accurately and efficiently.

These skills follow the Agent Skills Open Standard: https://agentskills.io/home

### Install the skills

Install directly with the Skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add chiragagg5k/appwrite-agent-skills
```

This installs the packaged `appwrite-*` skills into your local skills directory.

### Available language skills

- `appwrite-typescript`
- `appwrite-dart`
- `appwrite-kotlin`
- `appwrite-swift`
- `appwrite-php`
- `appwrite-python`
- `appwrite-ruby`
- `appwrite-go`
- `appwrite-dotnet`

### Usage

Skills are automatically available once installed. The agent will use them when relevant tasks are detected.

### Prompt examples

Use these as copy-paste prompt starters.

#### TypeScript (server-side)

```text
Use the appwrite-typescript skill.
Create a Node.js script that uses Users service to create a user, then adds an initial profile row in TablesDB.

Include error handling and a small retry for transient failures.
```

#### TypeScript (web client)

```text
Use the appwrite-typescript skill.
Build a browser login flow with Account service:
- email/password signup
- email/password session login
